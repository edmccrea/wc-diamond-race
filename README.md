# The Diamond Race

## Description

The purpose of this project was to write a tiny game called the diamond race. Four colored diamonds move from the start line to the finish line. A click on a diamond moves it one step to the right. It takes 10 steps to win. The score board shows the current scores. When one diamond has a score of 10, the diamonds stop responding to clicks. The reset button takes the diamonds back to start.

This is an updated version using classes and web components.

### Requirements and recommendations

- The game should be a single page web application with one index.html file.
- The game should be written in plain Javascript and CSS.
- No external libraries or frameworks should be used.
- The code should be modular and use classes.
- It is preferable, but not mandatory, to use web components.
- The code should be readable and maintainable by others than the author.
- It is preferable if the code is validated by ESLint.
- The code should be committed into a new git repository.
